Step 1: Text Processing
Objective: Clean and prepare the text data for analysis.

Loading the Dataset:

The Spambase dataset contains email messages labeled as spam or not spam (ham). Each email is represented by a vector of features.
Cleaning the Text:

Text cleaning involves removing unwanted characters, converting text to lowercase, and eliminating stop words (common words that add little meaning).
We can use the scrubadub library to handle sensitive information and clean the text.



Step 2: Text Sequencing
Objective: Convert cleaned text into sequences suitable for machine learning models.

Tokenization:

Tokenization is the process of converting text into smaller pieces, typically words or tokens.
The Tokenizer class from Keras can be used to convert text into sequences of integers.
Padding Sequences:

Since different emails may have different lengths, we need to pad the sequences to ensure uniform input size for the model.



Step 3: Model Selection
Objective: Choose and define a machine learning model to classify emails.

Model Architecture:
A simple neural network can be effective for text classification tasks. We can use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer to capture dependencies in the text data.



Step 4: Implementation
Objective: Train the model and evaluate its performance.

Preparing Data for Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance.
Training the Model:

Fit the model on the training data and validate it on the test data.
Evaluating the Model:

After training, evaluate the model’s accuracy on unseen data.
